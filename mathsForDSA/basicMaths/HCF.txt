-> ax - by = l

-> [ a, b = two given numbers;
     x, y = two values which we need to put to get the minimum value,
     l =minimum possible value
   ]

-> The lowest possible positive integer we can make with a and b
for any value of x and y is knows as HCF

-> So HCF(a, b) = min(ax - by) = l

-> example:

-> HCF(18 ,4)

    18x - 4y = l

    for y = 1, x = 4
    18 - 16 = 2
    so HCF (4, 18) = 2

-> Euclidean Algorithm:

    gcd (a, b) = gcd(rem(b, a), a)
