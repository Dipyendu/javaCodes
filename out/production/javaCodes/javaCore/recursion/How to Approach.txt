1. break down the problem into smaller problems
2. try to build the recurrence relation if needed
3. draw the recursion tree
4. about the tree:
    see the flow of functions, how they are getting in stack
    identify and focus on left tree calls and right tree calls
    draw the tree and pointer again and again using pen and paper
    use a debugger to see the flow
5. see how the values and what type of values are returned at each step
6. see where two function call will come out
7. in the end you will come out of the main function
